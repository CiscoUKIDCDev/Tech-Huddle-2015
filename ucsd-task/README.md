  #UCS Director Re-Skin
**Note: This is now obsolete, please see the new [ucsd-reskin](https://github.com/CiscoUKIDCDev/ucsd-reskin) project which is a full rewrite with comments, clean code and a full template system (+ equal functionality!)**

  This is a demonstration webserver designed to show UCS Director API
  Calls and how they can be used to make an alternative UI.
  
  To use you will need to edit the file ucsd_api.php and add the right IP address
  and API key.
  
  Note: It will only pick up Advanced Catalog items that have a small number of expected input fields
  
  There is no support for this and we do not recommend running it in a production environment.
