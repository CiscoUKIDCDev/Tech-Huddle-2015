#UCS Director Re-Skin
This is a demonstration webserver designed to show UCS Director API
Calls and how they can be used to make an alternative UI.

To use you will need to edit the file ucsd_api.php and add the right IP address
and API key.

Note: It will only pick up Advanced Catalog items that have a small number of expected input fields

There is no support for this and we do not recommend running it in a production environment.
